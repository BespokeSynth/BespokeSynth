When a midicontroller module set to "osccontroller" is placed in your patch, Bespoke supports OSC in various ways.

Direct control addressing:
	address: /bespoke/control/<control path>
	parameters: [f] or [i] or [s]
		This will attempt to write the value provided directly to the UI control's path.
		The <control path> should be a path like shown in the top left of Bespoke when hovering over a control. (tilde-separated)
		Use URL escaping to represent spaces (i.e., add "%20" instead of a space)
	example: /bespoke/control/notesequencer~length 4
	example: /bespoke/control/sampleplayer~cue%20len 5.3

Direct control addressing scaled:
	address: /bespoke/control_scaled/<control path>
	parameters: [f] or [i] or [s]
		This will attempt to write the value provided directly to the UI control's path while scaling the value to within the min and max of the control.
		The <control path> should be a path like shown in the top left of Bespoke when hovering over a control. (tilde-separated)
		Use URL escaping to represent spaces (i.e., add "%20" instead of a space)
		The the value is expected to be between 0 and 1.
	example: /bespoke/control_scaled/looper~offset .3
	example: /bespoke/control_scaled/sampleplayer~cue%20len .2

Notes:
	address: /bespoke/note
	parameters: [f, f] or [i, f, f]
		The second to last parameter is the note number corresponding to the standard midi notes.
		The last parameter is the velocity of the note.
		If three parameters are provided the first integer parameter will denote the note "channel".
	example: /note 60 127

Location store:
	address: /bespoke/location/store
	parameters: [f] or [i]
		Will save and overwrite the current viewports location and zoom into the specified location slot.
	Notes:
		These are the same location bookmarks used by the minimap.
		There is a limit of 10 location bookmarks (0 to 9).
	example: /bespoke/location/store 1

Location recall:
	address: /bespoke/location/recall
	parameters: [f] or [i]
		Will try to recall the specified viewport location.
	Notes:
		These are the same location bookmarks used by the minimap.
		There is a limit of 10 location bookmarks (0 to 9).
	example: /bespoke/location/recall 1

Any other addresses with parameters of type integer or float will be automapped to CC's in the midicontroller interface.
