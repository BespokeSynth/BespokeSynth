Bespoke supports OSC in various ways.

Notes:
	address: /note
	parameters: [f, f] or [i, f, f]
		The second to last parameter is the note number corresponding to the standard midi notes.
		The last parameter is the velocity of the note.
		If three parameters are provided the first integer parameter will denote the note "channel".

Bookmark recall:
	address: /bespoke/bookmark/recall
	parameters: [f] or [i]
		Will try to recall the specified viewport bookmark.
	Notes:
		These are the same bookmarks used by the minimap.
		There is a limit of 10 bookmarks (0 to 9).

Bookmark store:
	address: /bespoke/bookmark/store
	parameters: [f] or [i]
		Will save and overwrite the current viewports location and zoom into the specified bookmark slot.
	Notes:
		These are the same bookmarks used by the minimap.
		There is a limit of 10 bookmarks (0 to 9).


Direct addressing:
	address: /bespoke/addressable/<control path>
	parameters: [f] or [i] or [s]
		This will attempt to write the value provided directly to the UI control's path.
		The <control path> should be a path like shown in the top left of Bespoke when hovering over a control.

Any other address (provided the parameters are only of type integer or float) will be mapped to CC's in the midicontroller interface.
