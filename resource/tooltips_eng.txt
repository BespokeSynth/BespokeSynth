gridnotedisplayer~use with a gridkeyboard to display currently playing notes, to visualize chords, arpeggiation, etc.



chordholder~keeps any notes pressed at the same time sustaining, until new notes are pressed
~stop~stop notes from playing
~pulse to play~when enabled, input notes aren't played immediately, but instead wait for an input pulse before playing



chorder~takes an incoming pitch and plays additional notes to form chords
~diatonic~should the grid be chromatic, or locked to the scale only?
~chord~chord presets

capo~shifts incoming notes by semitones
~capo~number of semitones to shift

arpeggiator~arpeggiates held notes. there are several vestigial features in this module that should be cleaned up.
~interval~arpeggiation rate
~step~direction and distance to step through arpeggiation. a value of zero is "pingpong".
~octaves~how many octaves to step through



titlebar~
~save layout~[none]
~load~load a saved .bsk file to restore state
~save~save current state as .bsk file, to be restored later
~save as~save current state as a new .bsk file
~new patch~reset to the layout specified in "layout" in userprefs.json
~write audio~write the last 30 minutes of audio to your specified recordings_path
~ ? ~show help
~settings~adjust preferences, saved as userprefs.json
~load layout~[none]
~lookahead (exp.)~use lookahead scheduling, which is necessary for scriptmodule. gets automatically turned on when you use scriptmodule. so far, lookahead scheduling seems to not create any issues, but leaving this checkbox here just in case.
~autosave~every time a new module is added, trigger a save to data/savestate/autosave/, to help reload state in the event of a crash. can be quite slow if using modules with large samples.
~play/pause~stop all audio processing (shift-p)



newpatchconfirm~
~confirm~clear everything and start fresh
~cancel~dismiss this



vstplugin~a VST plugin instance
~vol~adjust the output volume
~program change~send a program change message to the VST instance
~open~show the plugin window
~show parameter~select parameters to display them, so they can be adjusted from within bespoke's interface. if a VST has more than 20 parameters, this list will initially be empty. in that case, to make a parameter appear in this list, wiggle it within the VST's interface.
~preset~choose from saved VST presets
~save as~save the current VST settings as a preset to load again later



transport~controls tempo and current time position
~tempo~global tempo, in beats per minute
~ + ~increase tempo by one
~ - ~decrease tempo by one
~swing~where the halfway point of musical time within the swing interval should fall. a value of .5 represents no swing.
~swing interval~interval over which to apply swing

~timesigbottom~time signature bottom value
~reset~reset timeline to zero
~ < ~nudge current time backward
~ > ~nudge current time forward
~set tempo~
~play/pause~stop all audio processing (shift-p)



transposefrom~transpose input from a specified root to the root of the current scale. the primary usage of this would be to allow you to play a keyboard in C, but it gets transposed to the current scale.
~root~root to transpose from

m185sequencer~sequencer using the unique paradigm of the the m185 or intellijel metropolis
~interval~interval per step
~reset step~resets counter to first step
~pitch*~pitch to use for this row
~pulses*~number of steps this row should last
~gate*~behavior for each row: "repeat" plays every step, "once" plays just the first step, "hold" holds across all steps, "rest" plays no steps





notestepper~output notes through a round robin of patch cables, to create sequential variety
