  <description>
    <p>Bespoke is a software modular synthesizer. It contains a bunch
    of modules, which you can connect together to create sounds.</p>
    <p>Bespoke is like a DAW* in some ways, but with less of a focus
    on a global timeline. Instead, it has a design more optimized for
    jamming and exploration.</p>

        <p>New modules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clockin/clockout: sync bespoke tempo to other devices
          via midi clock</li>
          <li>abletonlink: sync bespoke's tempo to ableton
          link-enabled apps</li>
          <li>songbuilder: pattern control interface to help you turn
          loops into songs (similar to a tracker's pattern sequencer,
          but bespokified)</li>
          <li>timelinecontrol: take control of bespoke's timeline
          position</li>
          <li>buffershuffler: a new stutter-like tool for slicing up
          live audio on a grid</li>
          <li>...plus a bunch of other utility modules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other cool stuff:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>added right-click quickspawn menu system to improve
          module spawning workflow</li>
          <li>added "drag cable into space" spawn system to speed up
          patch building workflow</li>
          <li>many significant additions to push 2 controller
          integration</li>
          <li>renamed presets module to snapshots module, and reframed
          it to be more useful as a performance/sequencing tool</li>
          <li>added a bunch of OSC support</li>
          <li>added looping deterministic modes to notechance,
          notehocket, and other randomization-driven modules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, fixed a bunch of bugs and crashes.</p>
