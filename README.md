# Bespoke Synth
A software modular synth that I've been building for myself since 2011, and now you can use it!

You can find the most recent builds for Mac/Windows/Linux at http://bespokesynth.com, or in the [Releases](https://github.com/awwbees/BespokeSynth/releases) section on GitHub.

### Building

In mid-September 2021 Bespoke moved to CMake rather than Projucer for builds. The prescription to build 
Bespoke on all platforms is

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BespokeSynth/BespokeSynth   # replace this with your fork if you forked
cd BespokeSynth
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -Bignore/build
cmake --build ignore/build --parallel 4
```

This will produce a release build in `ignore/build/BespokeSynth_artefacts`.

On Windows, the above cmake commands make Visual Studio project files in `ignore/build` which you can open and use directly
rather than the last step. Some windows systems also require the `-A x64` argument to force 64 bit.
On macOS if you would like to use Xcode, replace the second command with `cmake -Bignore/build -GXcode` 
and the ignore/build directory will contain xcode project files which you can use. Finally, the CMake file has a set
of options to enable other build features which are documented in the file.
